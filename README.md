# TTC-data-analysis

The Toronto Transit Comission (TTC) is the public transportation system used by over a million people in the Toronto, Ontario, Canada area. Modes of transportation provided include the streetcar, subway, and bus. Over the years, there have been changes in the numbers of riders on the TTC, which can be attributed to various reasons. This project will show the trends over the years from 2008-2023 and also focus in on how the ridership numbers changed during 2020, which is when the COVID-19 virus was declared a global pandemic.
